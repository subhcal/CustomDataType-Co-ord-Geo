## Features

- Create points in 2D space using `Coordinate(x, y)`.
- Perform arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Calculate the distance between two points.
- Find the midpoint between two points.
- Calculate the slope between two points.
- Check for equality and inequality between points.

## Installation
